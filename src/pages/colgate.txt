hello hello good evening good evening hi I hope you are doing well yes ok so just ask you how was your day today my day was really headache and I was very tired by the end of the day so what did you had your breakfast I had milk with loosely today and fruits also ok so just to briefly inform you that this is a sample interview that I will be taking and this is this will be used in a research study research kind of thing that I am doing so I will just take 10 to 15 minutes of
so just to ask very few questions it will take a 15 to 20 minutes so are you ready so my first question is which current brand of your which current brand of toothpaste are you using I am using Colgate ok so and what is your age I am 42 years ok you are 42 years and how many times do you brush your teeth in a day do it twice a day in the morning and before bedtime it is my routine so what do you like in your toothpaste what do I like in my toothpaste I think with a very
small quantity Colgate gives me complete everything it gives me freedom from my order bad smell sparkling teeth rate and even it keeps me away from my tooth decay and diseases also ok so have you ever tried any other brands of toothpaste yes recently I tried Patanjali it was ok but I think faith again is in Colgate only have been using since childhood in between few years back I tried Pepsodent also but I think it was quite hard my tooth so like Colgate suits is the best and how many years have you been using so have you ever thought of any feature that you don't like in Colgate is there any are Colgate can add a feature that if you are having tooth ache something can be added for we are using it on everyday basis so something can be done so that it prevents to take also ok so have you ever like if I were to ask you how much satisfied are you with your toothpaste on a scale of 1 to 10
what is it lacking like the to take one only or something else that Colgate is lacking something can be added to make your teeth more vital also because the brand that I am using Colgate I am using very simple Colgate I know that colga
many other varieties also yes it has a variety which mainly suggest that it was sparkling teeth it is for bad order so like before buying any toothpaste what all factors do you generally keep in mind or what things attract you
is its ability to keep my gums healthy cleaning what is and also cavities that that I would not catch cavity is also mainly these are the things that I looking for and these days I think Ayurvedic
toothpaste are also coming up in the market like where Clove is added new variant that has low added to it I've tried that also it is also good ok so like these were theis there any external thing like packaging or pricing that attracts you
that it should give you the things that you are required in a toothpaste so like you are much very much satisfied with your toothpaste is there anything like you are sooner or somewhere sooner thinking of switching to some other brand of toothpaste I have tried in between bathing I told you before also I have tried in between but again my faith again goes back to Colgate only this this was my interview and would you like to share something about the interview and how was it How to reply talking to you and you are very soft are you made me feel very comfortable I did not get nervous in between nothing it was one ok thank you for your time
